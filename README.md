# PowerShell
Collection of PS scripts and modules

Items in this repository invoke other items inside this repository through githubs api, for example New-SerialPort.ps1 invokes the class ValidDynamicPortNames.ps1 when run. These do so by a redirect through powershell.poecoh.com and api.powershell.poecoh.com, so in the event this repository gets moved to a new home everything can continue to function with a simple update to the domain redirect.

Domain is good until 2031, and unless a mistake is made I plan to keep it beyond that date.
